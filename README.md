## Description

**CHESS INSIGHT** is a free chess exploration tool inspired by chess.com's explorer feature, focusing on analyzing players' games.

## Inspiration

I love chess and i always wanted to improve my opening and i found the chess.com explorer option very interesting as it give u insight on your openings and gameplay tactics but unfortunately it's a premium feature and iam a broke college student :cry: so made my own implementation.


### Features

- Explore and analyze your games based on different game types.
- Filter games by blitz, bullet, and rapid formats.
- Load games from specific time periods for in-depth analysis.
